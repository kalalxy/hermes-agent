# ---------- Install stamp stages ----------
# CI pre-builds install-stamp.json (scripts/write_install_stamp.py,
# --distribution docker) with full git provenance before `docker build`.
# The stamp is COPY'd into the image so version_info.py and
# detect_install_method() can read it at runtime — .dockerignore excludes
# .git, so no commit is resolvable inside the image, and the stamp's
# `distribution` field is the only install-method marker the image carries.
#
# The stamp arrives via the bulk `COPY . .` below as
# /opt/hermes/install-stamp.json — already at its canonical, code-scoped
# path. It lives next to the code (NOT in $HERMES_HOME) so a host install
# sharing the bind-mounted data volume can never read the container's
# provenance as its own.
#
# If the file is absent (local `docker build` without CI), runtime falls
# through to "unknown" provenance with no crash.

# ---------- Base image ----------
# Node 26 source stage. Debian trixie's bundled nodejs is pinned to 20.x
# which reached EOL in April 2026 — but the runtime image's node does NOT
# come from here anymore: it comes from installation/runtime-pins.json via
# the provisioner (decision 8 — the uv_source stage this file used to have
# had already drifted to 0.11.6 while the pin table said 0.12.3, which is
# exactly the two-authorities failure the pin table exists to end). This
# stage remains ONLY as a build-time fallback for platforms the pin table
# does not cover; nothing COPYs from it into the runtime image today.

# every source-only commit re-did ~4-5 min of dep work on cold builds.
#
# README.md is referenced by pyproject.toml's `readme =` field, but it's
# excluded from the build context by .dockerignore's `*.md`.  uv's build
# frontend stats the readme path during dep resolution, so we `touch` an
# empty placeholder — the real README is restored by `COPY . .` below.
#
# `uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --extra all --extra messaging --extra otlp`
# installs the deps reachable through the composite `[all]` extra
# (handpicked set intended for the production image — excludes `[dev]`),
# plus gateway messaging adapters that should work in the published image
# without a first-boot lazy install.  We do NOT use `--all-extras`:
# that would pull in `[rl]` (atroposlib + tinker + torch + wandb from
# git), `[yc-bench]` (another git dep), and other aggregate profiles,
# none of which belong in the published container.
#
# Provider packages (anthropic, bedrock, azure-identity) are included
# so Docker users can use these providers without requiring runtime
# lazy-install access to PyPI (often blocked in containerized envs).
#
# The [otlp] extra contains the SDK/exporter imported by Hermes when Gateway
# Health export is enabled. Collector and observability-backend dependencies
# remain external and are not part of the Hermes production image.
#
# The hindsight memory provider's client (hindsight-client) is baked in
# for the same reason: it lazy-installs into /opt/hermes/.venv at first
# use, which lives inside the (immutable) image layer rather than the
# mounted /opt/data volume, so it is lost on every container recreate /
# image update and recall/retain then fails with
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hindsight_client'` (#38128).
#
# The Matrix gateway's deps ([matrix] extra) are baked in because
# python-olm (transitive via mautrix[encryption]) builds from source on
# Python/image combinations without usable wheels.  The Docker image is
# Linux-only, so keeping the native libolm/build-toolchain packages here
# avoids the cross-platform failures that kept [matrix] out of [all]
# while still making Matrix work in the published container. Fixes #30399.

# `docker exec` privilege-drop shim. When operators run
# `docker exec <c> hermes ...` they default to root, and any file the
# command writes under $HERMES_HOME (auth.json, .env, config.yaml) ends
# up root-owned and unreadable to the supervised gateway (UID 10000).
# The shim lives at /opt/hermes/bin/hermes, sits earliest on PATH, and
# transparently re-exec's the real venv binary via `s6-setuidgid hermes`
# when invoked as root. Non-root callers (supervised processes,
# `--user hermes`, etc.) hit the short-circuit path with no overhead.
# Recursion is impossible because the shim exec's the venv binary by
# absolute path (/opt/hermes/.venv/bin/hermes). See the shim source for
# the opt-out env var (HERMES_DOCKER_EXEC_AS_ROOT=1).

# Pre-s6 entrypoint.sh did `source .venv/bin/activate` which exported
# the venv bin onto PATH; Architecture B's main-wrapper.sh does the
# same for the container's main process, but `docker exec` and our
# cont-init.d scripts don't pass through the wrapper. Expose the venv
# bin globally so `docker exec <container> hermes ...` and any
# subprocess that doesn't activate the venv first still find hermes.
#
# /opt/hermes/bin is prepended ahead of the venv so the privilege-drop
# shim wins PATH resolution. The shim's last act is to exec the venv
# binary by absolute path, so this PATH ordering is transparent to
# every other consumer.

# The image ENTRYPOINT is a tiny dispatcher rather than `/init` directly.
# When the image really owns PID 1 (normal Docker / Podman), the dispatcher
# execs `/init` and preserves the full s6 supervision tree. When a platform
# wraps the image entrypoint under its own PID-1 init (Fly Machines,
# `docker run --init`, some schedulers), `/init` would abort with
# `can only run as pid 1`; in that case the dispatcher falls back to
# `stage2-hook.sh` + `main-wrapper.sh` directly so foreground commands still
# work. See #38349.
#
# On the PID-1 path, s6-overlay's /init sets up the supervision tree, runs
# /etc/cont-init.d/* (our stage2 hook), starts s6-rc services declared in
# /etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/, then exec's its remaining argv as the container's
# "main program" with stdin/stdout/stderr inherited (this is what makes
# interactive --tui work). When the main program exits, /init begins stage 3
# shutdown and the container exits with the program's exit code. Replaces
# tini — see Phase 2 of docs/plans/2026-05-07-s6-overlay-dynamic-subagent-gateways.md.
#
# We use the ENTRYPOINT+CMD split rather than CMD alone so the
# wrapper is prepended to user-supplied args automatically:
#
#   docker run <image>                  → entrypoint-dispatch.sh   (CMD default)
#   docker run <image> chat -q "hi"     → entrypoint-dispatch.sh chat -q hi
#   docker run <image> sleep infinity   → entrypoint-dispatch.sh sleep infinity
#   docker run <image> --tui            → entrypoint-dispatch.sh --tui
#
# main-wrapper.sh handles arg routing (bare-exec vs. hermes
# subcommand vs. no-args), drops to the hermes user via s6-setuidgid,
# and exec's the final program so its exit code becomes the container
# exit code. The dispatcher preserves that contract across both the
# supervised PID-1 path and the non-PID-1 fallback path. Without the
# wrapper-as-ENTRYPOINT, leading-dash args like `--version` would be
# intercepted by /init's POSIX shell.
