"""Install-scoped runtime tool registry.

The single source of truth for which tool versions THIS install of Hermes
manages and where they live. Two files, one owner each:

- ``<repo>/runtime-pins.json`` — the PINS. Every tool pins an EXACT
  version plus, per target, the exact download URL and its sha256.
  Versioned in the repo, code-reviewed, updated with the code that needs
  them. A tool may also declare ``extends``, naming the tools it plugs
  into; ORDER is derived from those edges rather than restated as a list
  in each reader (see ``install_order`` / ``path_order``).
- ``<install>/.hermes-runtime/runtimes.json`` — the FACTS. What is
  actually installed: version, path relative to the TOOL STORE, install
  timestamp, and the derived PATH order. Written ONLY by the
  provisioner; everything else reads.
- ``~/.hermes/tools/<tool>-<version>-<target>/`` — the BYTES. One entry
  per pinned tuple, shared by every install on the machine. Entries are
  immutable: a version bump writes a NEW entry and repoints the fact,
  because another install may be running the old one right now.

Facts and bytes are separate so that N installs cost N small JSON files
and ONE copy of node. Nothing on disk links the two — a fact names a
store-relative path, so the facts file IS the indirection layer.
``installation.paths.resolve_bases`` answers "which facts dir, which
store" for every reader, so none of them can disagree.

Readers (locators, the PATH assembler, doctor, uninstall) consume facts
through this module instead of probing paths. No path literals anywhere
else — that scatter is exactly what this replaces.

**Exact pins only, by design.** There is no version-range grammar and no
"resolve latest, then check it satisfies a range": that shape needs a
GitHub API call per tool (60 requests/hour unauthenticated), makes two
builds of the same commit disagree, and lets a tool change under users
without a code review. A pin bump is a deliberate edit — new version, new
urls, new digests, verified, committed.

Design doc: ``.hermes/plans/2026-08-12_hermes-home-lifetime-split.md``.

Pure logic (pin/facts parsing, target resolution, round-trip) lives here
with no side effects beyond explicit ``save_facts`` calls, so it is fully
unit-testable without a network or a real install.
