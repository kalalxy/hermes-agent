"""Derive who owns the running tree — no stored mode flags.

The install model is stamp-pure: ``.git`` says whether the tree is a
checkout, and the build stamp's REQUIRED ``updateMechanism`` says who
applies the next update.

* ``.git`` + stamp(``self``) is a **managed source checkout**: ``hermes
  update`` owns it. Installer-created checkouts are stamped at install
  time (and shipped pre-stamp installs are adopted once at a blessed
  root by ``step_adopt_blessed_checkout``).
* ``.git`` + no stamp is **somebody's working tree**: update refuses
  and points at ``git pull``.
* A stamp without ``.git`` is **sealed**: something external replaces
  the tree wholesale. The stamp names that steward in ``distribution``
  (``desktop-app``, ``docker``, ``nix``, or a future package manager).
* Neither is **unknown**.

If a future feature writes to user checkouts (nothing does today), it
must add an explicit opt-out fact FIRST. The old ``manageStyle: ejected``
stickiness guarded against desktop-side adoption and rematerialization;
both are deleted, so the guard went with them.

Hermes Agent runs as a published image (nousresearch/hermes-agent), not a

pulling a fresh image and restarting your container instead:

  docker pull nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest
  # then restart whatever started the container, e.g.:
  docker compose up -d --force-recreate hermes-agent
  # or, for ad-hoc runs, exit the current container and `docker run` again

Verify the new version after restart:
  docker run --rm nousresearch/hermes-agent:latest --version

Notes:
  • If you pinned a specific tag (e.g. ``:v0.14.0``) the ``:latest`` tag
    won't move your container — pull the newer tag you actually want, or
    switch to ``:latest`` / ``:main`` for rolling updates.  See available
    tags at https://hub.docker.com/r/nousresearch/hermes-agent/tags

    in the container, typically bind-mounted from the host) and persist
    across image upgrades — re-pulling doesn't lose any state.
