"""Provision managed runtime tools into the machine-wide tool store.

THE one dep engine: `hermes update` (post-update MACHINE_STEPS), the
installers (`python -m installation.provisioner`, after the pinned-uv
bootstrap), and the desktop payload staging all run this same code.

Per tool: read the EXACT pin for this target (url + sha256) → download →
verify the digest BEFORE extracting → stage into a scratch directory →
PUBLISH it into the store under ``<tool>-<version>-<target>`` with one
atomic rename → verify by RUNNING the binary → record the fact. A tool
that cannot be verified is not recorded: readers see it as unprovisioned
and fall back to system PATH, and the next run retries.

Bytes are shared, facts are not. The store is machine-wide, so several
installs (44 git worktrees, on the machine this was measured on) share
one copy of node rather than holding ~495MB each. Two rules make that
safe, and they are the whole concurrency story:

* **Publish atomically.** Staging happens in a scratch dir and lands with
  ``os.replace``, so a reader never sees a half-extracted entry.
* **Never mutate a published entry.** The name carries the version and
  the target, so an entry that exists already IS the pinned artifact —
  and another install may be executing it right now. A pin bump creates a
  NEW entry and repoints this install's fact at it.

Tools are visited in the pin table's dependency order, so a tool that
declares ``extends`` is staged after what it extends — npm is unpacked by
running the node it extends. The same edge, read the other way, is the
PATH order recorded into the facts file for both language readers.

There is no salvage and no "reuse whatever is lying around". A tool is
either the exact pinned artifact, verified by digest, or it is absent.
Adopting an unverified tree from a previous install would defeat the
point of pinning digests at all.

Progress streams as installer stage-JSON lines when --json is on, so the
GUI install driver renders provisioning natively.
