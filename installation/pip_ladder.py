"""The ONE managed-uv install path.

Three copies of an install strategy grew independently — dep-inventory
items #26 (``hermes_cli.tools_config._pip_install``), #27
(``tools.lazy_deps._venv_pip_install``, whose docstring admitted being a
mirror of #26), and #32 (``agent/lsp/install.py``'s pip-target branch).
Each drifted its own policy decisions into the mechanics. This module
owns the mechanics; callers own the policy through arguments.

There is no pip tier. Every install goes through the managed uv that
``installation.registry`` resolves from the store facts. The reasons:

* A pip tier resolves the same requirements a second time WITHOUT uv
  policy. ``exclude-newer`` and the ``[tool.uv]`` overrides live in uv
  configuration only, so a pip fallback can install a release the
  project quarantined, or resolve a backend backwards. The lazy path
  already treated a uv resolver verdict as final for exactly this
  reason, and the setup-hook path did not. One of the two was wrong.
* pip has no ``--overrides``. The pip tier needed a follow-up
  ``--no-deps`` repair pass to re-assert the security floor, which is a
  second resolution against a tree pip already changed.
* The venv is not guaranteed to have pip at all. The Windows installer
  creates it with ``uv venv``, which seeds none, so the pip tier needed
  an ensurepip bootstrap to heal a case that only existed because the
  ladder insisted on reaching pip.

An unprovisioned tree is a provisioning fault, not an install fault.
The result then names ``python -m installation.provisioner`` instead of
silently taking a weaker path.

``agent/_early_recovery.py`` keeps its own ensurepip call. That is
disaster recovery for a venv that cannot import this module, and it is
a documented exemption from this rule.

Stdlib-only by the run-don't-parse audit: this module runs in moments
when the venv is damaged, so it must not need anything a broken venv
cannot supply.
