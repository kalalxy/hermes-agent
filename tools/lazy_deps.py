"""
Lazy dependency installer for opt-in Hermes Agent backends.

Many Hermes features (Mistral TTS, ElevenLabs TTS, Honcho memory, Bedrock,
Slack, Matrix, etc.) need Python packages that not every user wants. Each
one installs at first use, for two reasons. One quarantined or yanked
release on PyPI must not fail the whole resolve and cost a fresh install
ten unrelated extras. And a user who talks to one provider must not pull
hundreds of packages that they never import.

Backends call :func:`ensure` at the
top of their first-import path. If the deps are missing, ``ensure`` checks
the ``security.allow_lazy_installs`` config flag (default true) and runs
a venv-scoped pip install. If the user has explicitly disabled lazy
installs, ``ensure`` raises :class:`FeatureUnavailable` with a clear
remediation hint pointing at ``hermes tools`` or the manual pip command.

Security model:

* **Venv-scoped by default.** Installs target ``sys.executable`` in the
  active venv. We never touch the system Python.
* **Sealed deployments.** The Docker image sets
  ``HERMES_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALLS=1`` and makes ``/opt/hermes`` read-only.
  Hermes refuses every install there. The image contains each extra that
  works in a container. A lazy install in the image means that the image
  does not have a dependency that it must ship.

* **Durable-target mode.** ``HERMES_LAZY_INSTALL_TARGET`` sends installs to
  a writable directory instead of the venv. The published image sets it to
  ``/opt/data/lazy-packages``, for :func:`install_specs` only: a plugin's
  packages come from its manifest, so no build can bake them. Hermes
  appends the directory to the END of ``sys.path``. It never prepends the
  directory, and it never exports ``PYTHONPATH``. The site-packages of the
  agent thus wins each name collision, and a package installed this way
  can only ADD modules.
* **PyPI by package name only.** Specs may be ``"package>=1.0,<2"`` etc.
  We do NOT support ``--index-url`` overrides, ``git+https://``, file:
  paths, or any other input that could be hijacked by a malicious config.
* **Allowlist.** Only specs that appear in :data:`LAZY_DEPS` can be
  installed via this path. A typo in feature name doesn't get the user
  install-anything semantics.
* **Opt-out.** Setting ``security.allow_lazy_installs: false`` in
  ``config.yaml`` disables runtime installs in BOTH modes. Users in
  restricted networks or strict security postures can pin themselves to
  whatever was installed at setup time.
* **Offline detection.** If the install fails (offline, mirror down,
  PyPI 404 / quarantine), we surface the failure as
  :class:`FeatureUnavailable` with the actual pip stderr — no silent
  retries, no caching of bad state.

Adding a new backend:

1. Add the packages as an extra in pyproject.toml, then map the feature
   to that extra in :data:`LAZY_DEPS`.
2. At the top of the backend module's import path, call
   ``ensure("feature.name")`` inside a try/except that converts
   :class:`FeatureUnavailable` to a useful runtime error.

    It applies the exact same environment routing as :func:`ensure`:

    * **Venv-scoped by default** — installs into ``sys.executable``'s venv.
    * **Durable-target on immutable images** — when the deployment seals the
      agent venv (``HERMES_DISABLE_LAZY_INSTALLS=1``) and sets
      ``HERMES_LAZY_INSTALL_TARGET``, installs are redirected to the writable
      data-volume dir (``--target`` + core-venv constraints), then activated
      on ``sys.path`` so the packages import in this process immediately.
    * **Gated** — honors ``security.allow_lazy_installs`` and refuses to run
      when the venv is sealed with no durable target (never attempts a write
      to a read-only tree; reports *why* instead of surfacing EROFS/EACCES).

    Unlike :func:`ensure`, a package outside pyproject.toml is permitted.
    Hindsight appends ``hindsight-all`` at setup time, and a plugin outside
    this repository declares its own packages, so a list of permitted names
    cannot work here.

    This function does NOT check the shape of a spec, and a check would give
    nothing. The specs come from ``plugin.yaml``, and the same file holds
    ``external_dependencies[].install``, which
    hermes_cli/web_server.py runs through ``subprocess.run(shell=True)``. The
    plugin's ``__init__.py`` runs as well, at import. Anyone who can write
