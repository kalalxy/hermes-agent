"""Lazy installs must not downgrade a security-pinned package.

``uv pip install`` and ``pip install`` do not read ``[tool.uv]
override-dependencies``. A backend whose transitive dependencies cap a
pinned package below its patched version therefore downgrades the core venv
the first time a user enables that backend.

The measured case: the venv holds ``cryptography==50.0.0``, and enabling
DingTalk pulls ``alibabacloud-tea-openapi==0.4.5``, which caps
``cryptography<49``, so the install resolves 48.0.1 and re-opens
GHSA-m2h6-j472-rp4c, GHSA-jwv3-5hgf-82ww and CVE-2026-69247.

tools/lazy_deps.py reads the override list out of pyproject.toml and gives
it to each installer tier. These tests check that both tiers receive it.
There is no test that two lists agree, because there is one list.

The two tiers are reached by uv being present or absent, never by uv
running and failing: that outcome is authoritative and ends the ladder.
The last test holds that boundary, because a fallthrough there would
discard uv policy such as exclude-newer.
