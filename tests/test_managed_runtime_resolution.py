"""Guard: Hermes-owned subprocesses must not resolve managed runtimes by bare PATH.

Hermes installs runtimes for itself — ``uv`` at ``$HERMES_HOME/bin/uv``, Node at
``$HERMES_HOME/node``. Neither directory is on the ambient PATH of an arbitrary
process, so ``shutil.which("uv")`` / ``shutil.which("node")`` in Hermes's own
code has two failure modes:

* the managed runtime is invisible, so the caller reports "not installed" or
  degrades to a slower tier on a machine that has exactly what it needed; and
* when a system copy also exists, the one Hermes does not own wins — which is
  how a generated systemd unit or launchd plist can bake a system Node in and
  keep resolving it across reboots.

The fix per call site is one of ``installation.nodejs.node_path()``,
``installation.env.managed_path_dirs()``, ``resolve_uv()``, or ``ensure_uv()``.
This test is
the ratchet that stops a new bare lookup from being added back.

Reading source is normally banned (see AGENTS.md). It is the right tool here and
only here: the property under test is "no call site anywhere in the tree spells
it this way", which is a statement about the whole codebase rather than about
one function's behavior, and there is no runtime seam that can observe a lookup
that was never written. Every entry in the allow-list below names a call site
whose behavior is separately covered by a real test.
