"""Boot-time post-update bootstrap.

Every install kind (git checkout, desktop bundled payload, docker, nix)
compares two per-install facts at boot:

* current identity — the commit this install IS: ``install-stamp.json``
  for sealed trees, ``.git/HEAD`` for checkouts. Reading it is a couple of
  file reads, no subprocess.
* last-known identity — the commit this install last bootstrapped, recorded
  under ``install-bootstrap/`` keyed by the canonical install root.

Equal → nothing happens (the fast path, ~2 ms). Different → run the
idempotent post-update steps from ``hermes_cli.post_update`` under a
single-flight lock, then record the new identity.

Two records, one per step scope:

* home record — ``get_hermes_home()/install-bootstrap/<key>.json``.
  Gates home-scoped steps. HERMES_HOME moves per profile, so each profile
  bootstraps its own state once per code change.
* machine record — ``<base home>/install-bootstrap/<key>.machine.json``,
  anchored to the DEFAULT home (HOME-anchored, not HERMES_HOME-anchored —
  the ``_get_profiles_root()`` convention). Every profile resolves the same
  file, so machine-global steps run once per machine per code change and
  the record's lock serializes concurrent profile boots.

The records are an optimization, never the correctness layer: every step is
idempotent and self-gating, so a deleted record costs one redundant slow
path, nothing more.
