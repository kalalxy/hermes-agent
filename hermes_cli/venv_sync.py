"""Sync the install's Python environment to its tree — and nothing else.

One of the two separately-invocable, stdlib-only halves of "make this
install runnable" (doc 3 round 3):

* ``installation.provisioner`` — pinned tools, shape-universal.
* THIS module — the venv, whose meaning depends on the install shape:

  - **checkout** (git clone + venv): run ``uv sync`` against the tree's
    ``pyproject.toml``/``uv.lock``. This is the only hash-verified path —
    the lockfile pins a SHA256 for every transitive, so a worm-poisoned
    release that PyPI has not yet quarantined is rejected instead of
    installed.
  - **sealed** (desktop bundle, nix, docker once unified): the base
    interpreter tree is a build artifact — syncing it is not possible
    and not meaningful. Exit 0 with ``{"state": "sealed"}``, cleanly.
    (The lazy-deps overlay half lands with the per-install state folder:
    a bundle swap must re-sync installed features against the new base
    tree. Until ``features.json`` exists there is nothing to read.)

Stdlib-only is a hard contract, enforced by the same AST audit that
covers ``installation``: this runs on freshly-cloned trees where the
venv does not exist yet, and after tree swaps where the venv is not
trustworthy — exactly the moments a third-party import would explode.

Why the sync is not just "run uv every time": ``uv sync`` on an
already-current venv still costs ~1-2s of resolver work, and the boot
path calls this through ``post_update``. The lockfile digest recorded in
``.hermes-runtime/cache/venv-sync.json`` makes currency a file read.

Invocation:

    python -m hermes_cli.venv_sync                # sync if stale
    python -m hermes_cli.venv_sync --check        # report, change nothing
    python -m hermes_cli.venv_sync --json         # machine-readable

Exit 0: current/synced/sealed. Exit 1: a sync was needed and failed.
