"""Lazy dependency bootstrapper for non-Python runtime deps.

Detection and prompting live here in Python — not in install.sh — because:
  1. shutil.which() works on every platform; install.sh needs bash.
  2. Detection is instant; spawning bash for a "is node installed?" check is waste.
  3. Python controls the UX (rich prompts, non-interactive fallback, TTY detection).

install.sh is still the *installation* backend because it has 1900 lines of
battle-tested OS detection and package-manager logic (apt/brew/pacman/dnf/
zypper/Termux/…).  Reimplementing that in Python would be huge duplication.

Deps that degrade gracefully (ripgrep → grep fallback, ffmpeg → skip conversion)
don't need ensure_dependency wired in — only hard-fail sites do (TUI needs node,
browser tool needs agent-browser).
