 *   repo/                  plain source tree at the release tag (no .git),

 *                          at build time with `pip install --target` on the

 *   node/                  official node dist for this platform/arch
 *
 * Gating: the script does nothing unless HERMES_DESKTOP_VARIANT=bundled.
 * That variable is an internal build-time env for CI wiring, not user
 * config. Thus dev builds and current CI keep producing external builds.
 * There is no per-item skip: an embedded payload is complete, or this
 * script throws and the build fails.
 *
 * The heavy work shells out to git, uv, and tar. The decision logic
 * (target resolution, pip arg construction, manifest shape) is exported as
 * pure functions. Thus vitest covers it without network or toolchains.
